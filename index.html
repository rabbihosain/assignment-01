	<p>Hi, I am Rabbi Hosain from Sherpur, Bangladesh. I am studing in honours final year in Mathematics in Sherpur Govt college. At the same time I am trying to my best for being a professional Web Developer.I have basic knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have pretty knowledge about wodpress CMS as well. But I know person who have only basic about web design can not earn from international marketplace. He have to a deep knowledge and experience about these. Only then he/she can hope for earning from freelance marketplace.However, I want to be highly skilled web developer taking the training from LEDP.</p>
	<p>At last, I want to give cordial thanks for the Government of Bangladesh. I would like to thanks my mentor and other co-operator including the project as well.</p>
